mealpy project-
The purpose of this project is to practice using different optimization methods.
our code is optimize the algorthim that run multi problems in multi models in 5,10,20 and 40 dims, each dim for 30 trial with 30 different starting points and we save for each problem the average fit and the SD for each model by using mealpy library in python.
we start with 20 hour run time and we succeeded to decrease the time to 3 hours by using multi threads, Each core (CPU) will handle a prolblem, each problem will run 30 times.
we will be happy to hear what you think :).
